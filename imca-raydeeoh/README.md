# imca-raydeeoh
IMCA RAYDEEOH was a web radio founded by Intermedia students at Concordia University, located on unceded Kanien'keh√°:ka territory. The purpose of this web radio was to showcase the work of students who were interested in sharing their own sound pieces, transmission artworks, podcasts, and any other forms of audio content relating to DIY, experimental or non-mainstream arts. IMCA RAYDEEOH was a platform for these students to create and promote their work outside of the context of a campus radio station, art gallery or artist run center, while still operating within the context of the Concordia University community.

Note: This website was originally created by myself (front-end) and Matthew Halpenny (back-end) in 2019. We we're both still new to coding at the time (my code was absolute spaghetti) so I've decided to redo the front-end from the original mock-ups for the sake of this portfolio. You can find the complete original project archived [here](https://github.com/sbordel/imca-raydeeoh).
