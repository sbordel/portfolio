PROJECT 1: A Night at the Movies
SUNNY AND JIMMY-PIERRE

Sonny and Jimmy-Pierre is a reinterpretation of David Lynch's infamous (and so sadly unpopular) short-length movie titled Pierre and Sonny Jim (2001) rendered as a playful web-based game. This interactive piece is a reenactment of — and with no further development — the only scene of this movie, staging two latex glove-shaped balloons screaming at each other. This altercation is located in a countryside-seeming landscape lit by an early morning blue sky. In this movie, Pierre and Sonny Jim (which I assume are the names of our previously mentioned balloon duo) are gesticulating frantically across the screen all the while emitting high-pitched squeals.  

First greeted with soothing sounds of nature upon entry of the website, users choosing to engage with our two balloon friends will be met with chaotic piercing sounds and agitated movements which can be activated through various mouse interactions. This interactive scene was built using different forms of media, including gifs made from altered stock images, 3D objects, sound clips, and a digitally rendered collage to piece everything together.  

Pierre and Sonny Jim was my film of choice for this project as the elements constituting it and its overall aesthetic are amusing, absurd (and annoying in a charming way) which I thought could be interesting to recreate using an amalgam of digital resources. Coming from an Intermedia background, my first instinct in the process of making this project was to create multiple objects varying in formats and in visual quality which I would then use as assets to build the environment. While coding is still an unfamiliar practice for me, this project was a challenging way in learning how to implement objects of different nature in the same canvas without them conflicting with each other.
